# Mathematical-Misc
Multiple scripts that I have written to explore mathematical and stochastic ideas that I find interesting

# Light Bulb Optimisation Game
In the game, a light bulb's switch on time is normally random with a mean of 5 seconds and standard deviation of 1 second.

You have one hour to make as many checks on the light bulb as you would like.
Each check marks the end of that run and the next run begins.
If the light bulb is on at time of checking the on/off status of the light bulb, then you win one point.
The optimisation problem is to find the optimal amount of time to wait before checking the light bulb on/off status to maximise the number of points you win in one hour, which this code does numerically.

# Martingale Strategy Experimentation
Investigated the Martingale betting strategy by simulating the stochastic environment of 50/50 betting games, to better understand random processes. Experimented with changing initial balance and measuring how the maximum profit point changes.

# NDI Visualisation
I wrote a short script to visualise and better understand the Normalised Difference Index equation, which I specifically used to convert financial sentiment values in the format of $p$(negative), $p$(neutral), and $p$(positive) into a float between -1 and 1.
